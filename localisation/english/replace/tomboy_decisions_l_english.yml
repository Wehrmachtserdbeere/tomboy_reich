  BEL_monafash_bop_fash_recruit_paramilitaries: "Fascist Paramilitary Recruitment"
  BEL_monafash_bop_fash_recruit_paramilitaries_desc: "By granting the Fascists more rights in the government, we can get their paramilitaries out of the streets and the military. Though by doing that, our industry may suffer. They will, of course, get more influence in the government, which may anger the monarchists, who will, in turn, demand more influence in the government too."

They will, however, attempt to use the authority of their ministries to promote Fascist ideology within the nation.

  BEL_monafash_bop_mona_secure_minor_noble_marriages_desc: "By marrying minor nobles around the realm, we can solidify alliances and ties within them, which will keep them under our influence.

  BEL_bop_fascism_rm_curb_sturmkommando_influence: "Curb Sturmkommando Influence"
  BEL_bop_fascism_rm_curb_sturmkommando_influence_desc: "Using intricate political maneuvering and subversive tactics, planting undercover agents, sewing distrust among the Sturmkommandos, and bribery, we can decrease their influence over the Kriegsamt, thereby promoting the Reichsmilitär and deradicalizing our military to some degree."


  BEL_bop_fascism_sk_purge_rm_officers: "Purge Reichsmilitär Officers"
  BEL_bop_fascism_sk_purge_rm_officers_desc: "By \"retiring\" some Reichsmilitär Officers, we can increase the power that the Sturmkommando has over the Kriegsamt, which will make them far more powerful for a while. Of course, we might lose some very competent officers and receive a hit on our military's morale. Though it is unlikely that anyone will ever do anything about this, so the military might remain unaffected."

  BEL_bop_fascism_rm_purge_sk_officers: "Purge Sturmkommando Officers"
  BEL_bop_fascism_rm_purge_sk_officers_desc: "It's undeniable that the Sturmkommando is too powerful as it currently is. As such, charging a few of them with the various crimes they've committed is a good start in reducing their power, and their influence over the military will decrease. Certainly some more radicalized people will leave, but they're easily replaced by more loyal Reichsmilitär and impartial soldiers."

  BEL_bop_fascism_sk_enlarge_sturmkommando: "Enlarge the Sturmkommando"
  BEL_bop_fascism_sk_enlarge_sturmkommando_desc: "We can bolster the ranks of the Sturmkommando with young and radicalized men from the countryside, which will grant the Sturmkommando a larger enough military to more properly enforce its will in the cities and wars. The only real drawback is the increased radicalization of the military, and the increased brutality during occupations."



  BEL_bop_demsoc_decisions_category: "Democrat-Socialist Balance of Power"
  BEL_bop_demsoc_decisions_category_desc: "The balance of power between the Democrats and Socialists are inherently the people's choice, and we must respect that. However, we can influence the balance of power between the two factions, and we can use that to our advantage. At best, we would prevent what happened in the Soviet Union, since most of us still hold our Queen dear to our hearts."
