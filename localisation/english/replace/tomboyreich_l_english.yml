His only goal is to cleanse the world and get rid of these lesser races and those that were not born into the right bloodline or didn't follow the divine path properly. The ultimate aim for every other being who had fallen away from grace would be nothing but annihilation. Those that weren't part of his cause must die forever, because they are just worthless slaves anyway."

    POLITICS_WASTELAND_DESC: "The Wastelands, once known as Poland, stand as a grim testament to a bygone era of vibrant life and civilization. This once-thriving country has been reduced to a desolate and unforgiving landscape, where the remnants of a once-proud society now lay in ruins.\nAs one ventures into the Wastelands, they are greeted by a haunting silence, interrupted only by the occasional howling wind and the distant echoes of crumbling structures. The landscape is dominated by a bleak tableau of decaying cities, shattered infrastructure, and overgrown vegetation reclaiming its territory.\nAny signs of human habitation are now reduced to little more than dilapidated husks, where buildings that once teemed with activity now stand as hollow, crumbling shells. Rusting vehicles and remnants of a forgotten time are scattered like grotesque artifacts, testaments to a civilization that once was.\nLife in the Wastelands, as it struggles to persist, has been transformed into something feral and untamed. The few remaining organisms, whether mutated remnants of the past or new, hardy species, have evolved to adapt to this harsh, unforgiving environment. They are defined by their fierce determination to survive, often displaying aggression and territoriality as they vie for the scarce resources that the Wastelands begrudgingly offer.\nThe air is thick with an acrid scent, a blend of dust and decay that serves as a constant reminder of the world that once was. Toxic remnants, both natural and man-made, further threaten any attempts at reclaiming the land. The soil, once fertile, now lies barren and poisoned, unable to sustain the life it once nurtured.\nTravel through the Wastelands is perilous, fraught with danger at every turn. Those who dare to venture into this forsaken realm do so at their own peril, facing not only the physical challenges but also the haunting echoes of a once-thriving civilization. The boundaries of reality blur in this desolation, where time seems to have lost its meaning, and the past and present meld into a surreal tapestry of despair.\nIn the Wastelands, the remnants of Poland's vibrant history stand as silent witnesses to a time long past, a stark reminder of the fragility of human existence and the devastating toll of unchecked destruction. This land, once teeming with life, now serves as a stark cautionary tale for generations yet to come."

Her almost unhinged hatred of non-White and non-Japanese races, as well as her obsession with eugenics and racial superiority, has made her a source of controversy in the land. There have been times where people we considered extreme were concerned by some of the things she has said in her music, which she tries to pass off as jokes, but it's clear to anyone that listens to them that she is not joking, but rather expressing a genuine hatred for non-Whites and a desire for the extermination of non-Japanese races, and even some Japanese people she finds to be undesirable.\nShe has also expressed an interest in eugenics, and her songs often feature lyrics that glorify the idea of a superior race and the need to purify society of those who do not meet the standards she has set forth.\nShe has invented a weird genre of what she calls \"metal\" music, so-called \"National Socialist White Metal\", and it seems to be very popular within extreme circles. Her music is very extreme, and she seems to have a lot of fun making it.

It's said that the Prismriver Ensemble has the power to reinvigorate soldiers and give them the will to fight again, though Merlin and her sisters are well aware that most audiences just like to dance and drink to their music.

Born on May 18, 1869, in Munich, Rupprecht was the eldest son of Ludwig III, the last King of Bavaria, and Maria Theresa of Austria-Este.\n\nAs the Crown Prince, Rupprecht was the heir apparent to the Bavarian throne, which held significant historical and cultural importance in the southern region of Germany. The House of Wittelsbach, to which he belonged, had a long and illustrious lineage that traced back to the Middle Ages.\n\nRupprecht received a comprehensive education and demonstrated a keen interest in military affairs from an early age. He attended the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and completed his military training, eventually rising through the ranks and becoming a skilled military strategist and tactician.\n\nThe Crown Prince's military career flourished, and he played a notable role during World War I. As a commander of the Bavarian Army, he led his forces with distinction in several key battles. Rupprecht's leadership and bravery earned him respect and admiration among his troops and fellow officers.\n\nAside from his military prowess, Rupprecht was known for his deep appreciation of the arts and sciences. He was a patron of culture and supported various artistic endeavors, contributing to the enrichment of Bavarian society and heritage.\n\nIn addition to his role as Crown Prince, Rupprecht held various titles such as Duke of Bavaria, Franconia, and in Swabia, and Count Palatine by the Rhine. These titles emphasized his significance and influence within the regional nobility.\n\nThroughout his life, Rupprecht remained a dedicated family man and was married to Duchess Marie Gabrielle in Bavaria, with whom he had ten children. His devotion to his family and the welfare of Bavaria endeared him to his subjects, and he was widely respected as a responsible and compassionate leader.\n\nRupprecht's reign as Crown Prince, however, came to an end following the fall of the German monarchy after World War I. The Weimar Republic replaced the German Empire, leading to the dissolution of many royal titles and positions, including Rupprecht's claim to the Bavarian throne.\n\nAlthough no longer a reigning monarch, Rupprecht continued to serve Bavaria and Germany with dedication, maintaining his commitment to public service and philanthropy. His legacy as a respected military leader and a significant figure in Bavarian history endures, even after the fall of the Monarchy."
