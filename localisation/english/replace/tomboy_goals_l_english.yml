  BEL_acceptance_popularize: "Increase support for Tomboys"
  BEL_acceptance_popularize_desc: "Only recently did we take over this beautiful country. Because of this, the general population and older generations are still rebelling. They believe that the concept of tomboys is ridiculous. We must... convince them of their misbelief."

  BEL_acceptance_legislation: "Declare Tomboy Rights"
  BEL_acceptance_legislation_desc: "In a society dominated by men, Tomboys are left behind with the rest of the women. By increasing the laws of acceptance for us, we will become more powerful and influential."

  BEL_acceptance_work: "Equal Working Rights"
  BEL_acceptance_work_desc: "By allowing tomboys to work, we can prove that we are equally as strong as men. This will also improve the economy by effectively doubling our civilian manpower."

  BEL_acceptance_army: "Tomboys in the Army"
  BEL_acceptance_army_desc: "Now that the constitution allows more rights for us in the civilian sector, it is time to extend that to the military. By having Tomboys fighting side by side with male soldiers, we can prove our strength."

  BEL_acceptance_politics: "Tomboys in the Cabinet"
  BEL_acceptance_politics_desc: "It's time for us to put tomboys into the cabinet. By opening political schools for us, we may prepare them for the ruling to come."

  BEL_acceptance_campaign: "Tomboy Campaigns"
  BEL_acceptance_campaign_desc: "It is imperative we increase the popularity of Tomboys. By campaigning in the streets with posters and flyers, we can show the world what we're capable of... or at least our country."

  BEL_acceptance_zeitgeist: "The National Belief"
  BEL_acceptance_zeitgeist_desc: "After showing the nation the strength and superiority of Tomboys, we must improve their position in this country by making them the defining spirit of the hierarchy."

  BEL_acceptance_supremacy: "Absolute Supremacy"
  BEL_acceptance_supremacy_desc: "It's time. We've proved to all generations that the Tomboys are a capable bunch. By proving that we unite the best in both men and women in one, it will be evident to all doubters that we are superior to them. We shall show this to the world."

  BEL_political_crack_down: "Crack down on Political Discourse"
  BEL_political_crack_down_desc: "Now that the people have shown their allegiances, we can very effectively crack down on dissent. With no organized opposition to speak of, it will be easy for us to quell any public criticism or attempts at reform. Our system will soon be unassailable and irreversible! The citizens need never question again why they should follow our laws and traditions."

  BEL_monarchism_the_monarch_alone: "Protect the Kingdom"
  BEL_monarchism_the_monarch_alone_desc: "It is unthinkable that Tomboys would be led by anyone other than a monarch! The crown must be propped up at all costs, even with our lives. It was Lady Lalatina who forged this Kingdom and Lady Lalatina who first led it. Why should that change? The House of Dustiness Ford shall lead the Tomboy to a glorious future!"

  BEL_monarchism_instigate: "Instigate Violence"
  BEL_monarchism_instigate_desc: "There have been protests because of our recent decisions. If we infiltrate their ranks, we can force them to become violent, the people will quickly lose their faith and support in any more protests, allowing us to implement new laws without issue."

  BEL_monarchism_condemn_dem: "Condemn Democracy"
  BEL_monarchism_condemn_dem_desc: "We are Monarchists through and through, because we believe in the Divine right of Kings. But since the French Revolutions, ideas such as \"Democracy\" and \"Individualism\" have spread among us; this is something which has no place in our country. They riot to put in place radicals that would ruin our nation like they did in Russia! We must squash these ideas for good before they take hold of our people."

  BEL_monarchism_prosecute_fascists: "Prosecute Fascists"
  BEL_monarchism_prosecute_fascists_desc: "The rise of fascism under Mussolini, his inept rule after the King appointed and became a puppet to him, and recently the ascension of Adolf Hitler, who backstabbed their Kaiser to get more popularity, should serve as a reminder to us all that true leadership comes from those with blood ties to the throne. Those who truly fight for the monarchy can be trusted, while those who don't must be destroyed."

  BEL_monarchism_recruit_black_youth: "Recruit the Black Youth"
  BEL_monarchism_recruit_black_youth_desc: "After expelling the ideology of fascism from our nation, there are still remnants, especially their Black Youth, a militant youth wing of their party. It seems that even though we've succeeded in getting rid of fascism, some young fools still need their militarism, so we will take any opportunity to convert them to our cause! Their strong sense of discipline makes them excellent soldiers; their bravery unrivaled."

  BEL_monarchism_prosecute_commies: "Prosecute Communists"
  BEL_monarchism_prosecute_commies_desc: "We have seen what communism does in the Russian Revolution and the subsequent murder of Tsar Nicholas II and his family. Communism directly threatens our Queen and they do not shy away from violence either. So long as the royal house reigns over us, we will never accept Communism or allow it to take root among our people. We have to destroy this evil force before it gains too much power."

  BEL_monarchism_adopt_commie_tactics: "Adopt Communist Propaganda Tactics"
  BEL_monarchism_adopt_commie_tactics_desc: "Communism is evil. Despite that, their propaganda tactics work wonders on the common man who has been raised to believe all sorts of things. In order to counter enemy propaganda, we must adopt similar propaganda tactics used by the communists themselves. Using slogans to unite the common man against the enemy, or even to just not rebel, will be incredibly useful."

  BEL_monarchism_prosecute_dem: "Prosecute Democrats"
  BEL_monarchism_prosecute_dem_desc: "After decades of suffering under the Belgian liberal democracy, we're seeing a rise in radical left-wing movements and ideas. To combat these trends, which are fueled by socialist and communist ideals, we must persecute the very notion of democracy and use every available tool at our disposal to squash its growth."

  BEL_monarchism_give_dems_alternative: "Give Democrats an alternative"
  BEL_monarchism_give_dems_alternative_desc: "We fully outlawed democracy in our nation after witnessing how terrible its results could be for our country; however, because many citizens still support it, we'll give them an outlet so they won't go insane with anger towards us - The military. That way we can also force ideals of loyalty and discipline into their heads."

  BEL_monarchism_integrate_militants: "Integrate Far-Right Militants"
  BEL_monarchism_integrate_militants_desc: "The remnants of the far-right still has a lot of militias within our country. If we can integrate these groups and convince them that our royal house is the true way of our people, then they should become loyal soldiers. This is also a chance to recruit some more fighters to strengthen our army."

  BEL_monarchism_integrate_leftists: "Integrate the Left Wing"
  BEL_monarchism_integrate_leftists_desc: "Since Monarchism is the only thing unbanned, the remaining far-left forces aren't strong enough to pose any threat to us. They will either leave, or they will be schooled into becoming loyal to us. Either option is fine by us."

  BEL_monarchism_consolidate: "Consolidate the Queen's Power"
  BEL_monarchism_consolidate_desc: "The Queen is the most important person in the Kingdom; if she dies or disappears, everything will crumble. Therefore, we need to consolidate her power to remove any foreign influences on her life and our country. After all, what good does a ruler who has lost their power do? She must have absolute control over all aspects of the state."
  BEL_consolidate_tt: "Finishing this focus will open up §Ymore possibilities§!."

  BEL_monarchism_prepare_army: "Prepare an Army"
  BEL_monarchism_prepare_army_desc: "The Belgian army was incredibly weak, and now that we are in power, a lot of the men left, because they refused to be commanded by tomboys. Right now, the army's only available soldiers are a few tomboys, and some of the men who didn't leave. Before we plan any military operations, we first need to focus on building an army strong enough to contend with the powers at play in Europe."

  BEL_monarchism_demand_referendums: "Demand Benelux Referendums"
  BEL_monarchism_demand_referendums_desc: "Now that we have a proper army, we will utilize it to put pressure on Luxembourg and the Netherlands to hold referendums under our terms, guaranteeing it would result in them joining us, while pretending it to be fully democratic, although some people may claim that our heavy military presence will amount to electoral malpractice."
  BEL_warring_wont_be_asked_tt: "Countries at war will §Rnot§! be asked, you will receive a §Ywargoal§! instead!"

  BEL_monarchism_subjugate_for_safety: "Subjugation for Safety"
  BEL_monarchism_subjugate_for_safety_desc: "Instead of a fraudulent democratic referendum or an alliance, with our military power, we can perhaps convince [HOL.GetNameDef] and [LUX.GetNameDef] to join us voluntarily as puppet-states, with the promise that with us around, they will be safer from aggressive nation-states. Of course, they would be less likely to accept it without a monarchy, but even if they deny, we have other methods."

  BEL_monarchism_propose_protective_alliance: "Propose an alliance"
  BEL_monarchism_propose_protective_alliance_desc: "By proposing an alliance between the monarchist Benelux nations, we can avoid using fraudulent democracy and threats on them. And after all, the whole point of putting influence on them is that so all three of our countries can flourish and survive. Through this, we can work together to create a strong influence on European and world politics. Other big countries can watch us apprehension when the time comes."

  BEL_monarchism_integrate_netherlands: "Integrate [HOL.GetName]"
  BEL_monarchism_integrate_netherlands_desc: "Fully controlling the Netherlands, we can use some delicate diplomacy to formalize them as our core territory. If we replace all Dutch politicians, down to the local level, and replace them with loyal [BEL.GetAdjective]s, then after some time our core will be legitimate in everyone's views."

  BEL_monarchism_prepare_further_expansion: "Prepare further expansions"
  BEL_monarchism_prepare_further_expansion_desc: "With either the Benelux under friendly control, or a strong enough army, the next objective should be to expand our borders to the true extend of what we should have been, especially into Germany and France, although some Colonies would be nice as well. Only the war powers and size of our nation will let us do so in the long-run, so we must be prepared."

But whether it be through peaceful or forceful means, we require extensive preparation to ensure success in either scenario. If we can get every corner of our planning perfect, it will give us an unbeatable advantage to take over Britain as soon as possible."

  BEL_monarchism_british_contact_diplomats: "§BContact [ENG.GetAdjective] Diplomats§!"
  BEL_monarchism_british_contact_diplomats_desc: "Contacting British Diplomats and remedying the relationship between our two countries is a good starting point. If our diplomatic relationship has soured and it hasn't recovered in some years, then that could be a hint of a hostile relation. However, if our relationship has been friendly and our international affairs haven't collapsed into tragedy, then it would be a good sign that we mean well."

  BEL_monarchism_british_sponsor_state_visit: "Sponsor [ENG.GetAdjective] State Visit"
  BEL_monarchism_british_sponsor_state_visit_desc: "Through an invite to [BEL.capital.GetName], we can allow important [ENG.GetAdjective] politicians to visit us, and return the favor. After so long, it would be a chance to give our nation the boost in international fame that it lacks, while also giving us the chance to improve our relations with Britain. Along with this, Britain may take this as a sign of sincerity to prove our trustworthiness."

  BEL_monarchism_british_trade_agreement: "Propose [BEL.GetAdjective]-[ENG.GetAdjective] Trade Treaty"
  BEL_monarchism_british_trade_agreement_desc: "A good way to prepare for peacefully taking over the [ENG.GetAdjective] is to gradually strengthen our influence over their economy. Even if they're is reluctant to acknowledge our intentions, they shouldn't reject economic progress if they like us. Without realizing, we'll be selling ourselves as a good ally, if our nations' economic interests are connected. This would be just a first step in a deep connection."

  BEL_britain_friendship_desc: "Instead of sowing discord and dissent among the British people, we can get them on our side instead. Appeal to them by trying to prove ourselves as good-natured allies. First through the monarchy itself, the Queen can officially declare friendship with the British monarchy, which also works as a message to the UK people, that we wouldn't try to attack them. Secondly through diplomacy to suggest an alliance."

We can further strengthen this friendship and make it into something as binding as an alliance, due to the large influence we have over them.

The Weltkrieg, defined by trench warfare and futile combat, is proof that standing on equal footing with another enemy army will lead to stalemate and death for everyone.

He left it up to us, however, to bring these divisions over the Channel."

  BEL_monarchism_britain_over_the_channel_desc: "Challenging the British on the sea is suicide. So instead of that, with our combined arms being sufficient enough to deal with their inferior air force, we can parachute into their mainland, and effectively skip the need to deal with their fleet.

  BEL_monarchism_britain_challenge_britannia_desc: "One of the ways to conquer Britain is through challenging the might of their Royal Navy.

  BEL_monafash_imperialism_east_poland_integrate_desc: "With [POL.GetName] now a part of our country, it's time for the integration process to begin. By integrating Poland into our nation, we can bring the Polish Tomboys back home, and turn the unused land into productive farms and industrial factories. This will further bolster our economy, and will pave the way for a bright and prosperous future for all of our people."

  BEL_monafash_imperialism_east_bulwark: "Bulwark against the East"
  BEL_monafash_imperialism_east_bulwark_desc: "It's obvious that the East is on a path of destruction. From the Bolsheviks to the Maoists, the East is filled with tyrants and maniacs who want nothing but total eradication and enslavement of innocents. We have no choice but to defend ourselves and our neighbors, and the best way to do this is through an impregnable, iron defense. An \"Iron Curtain\" if you will."

  BEL_fascism_fascist_ascendance_desc: "Having seen the failures that monarchism brought, especially after the springtime of nations, it has become clear that the monarchist system cannot be trusted to lead the country into a good future. The people deserve a better leadership, one who is strong because of their merit and willpower, rather than some obscure bloodline of questionable merit."

  BEL_fascism_united_by_blood_desc: "Many of our traits as tomboys are genetic. Be it our body shapes, our athletic capabilities, our mental abilities, our facial features, our sexual orientation, or even our love for the Lord, we have inherited them from our ancestors. And it is our duty to ensure that these traits continue to exist and are passed down to future generations. This duty, and this blood unites us."

  BEL_fascism_disunited_by_politics: "Disunited by Politics..."
  BEL_fascism_disunited_by_politics_desc: "Politics, the greatest tool of manipulation. Used to divide the people, to make them distrust and hate each other. This has made it easier for foreign powers to destroy and conquer us. That must never happen, but it is a sad reality that politics are a fundamental part of life, and thus we cannot remove it. However, we can change the nature of politics, to unify the people and make us stronger."

  BEL_fascism_disunited_by_borders: "Disunited by Borders..."

  BEL_fascism_war_establish_kriegsamt_desc: "To achieve the new Tomboy Empire, we'll need a new military structure, and a new, unified Tomboy Army. With this new Imperiales Kriegsamt, we will have a modern, professional, and unified army department that is ready to defend our nation from any and all threats. Even with only the plan, two factions have already formed - the radical Sturmkommando, and the moderate Reichsmilitär; both have different ideas for how war should be fought."





  BEL_fascism_war_the_army: "The Army"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_army_desc: "We'll create the Army section of the Kriegsamt and focus our resources and attention there.

  BEL_fascism_war_the_army_infantry_special_forces_desc: "Every military needs special forces. Small groups of the best tomboys, equipped with the best gear, trained in the best conditions, and given the best training. A unit that is specialized in certain conditions that other troops can't operate in, and will give us an advantage in many situations."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_army_invest_in_radars_desc: "Investing in the currently little-used radar technology will give us an advantage over the other countries. Not only will the technology allow us to find and destroy incoming attacks, it will also improve the efficiency of our division's missions."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr: "The Luftwehr"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr_desc: "The Luftwaffe is our project to manage the aerial aspect of our armed forces. Our country doesn't have a formiddable aerial defense force yet, so this project can help us get to know more about aerial combat and be able to defend ourselves more better against any invading countries that plans to bomb us."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr_air_superiority_focus: "Air Superiority Focus"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr_air_superiority_focus_desc: "So far the Luftwehr is mostly unfocusing on its aerial doctrine. We can prioritize air superiority and intercept enemy aircraft and research air-superiority fighters primarily tasked with destroying or driving off enemy aircraft to establish air superiority on the battlefield and over our country."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr_ground_support_focus: "Ground Support Focus"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr_ground_support_focus_desc: "As we have very limited funds for the time being, we will need to make do with whatever resources we currently have. We cannot support an intricate network of bombers that would be used to conduct heavy bombing runs on foreign countries in far off lands, but we can certainly use our planes to closely support our land forces."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr_bombing_focus: "Bomber Focus"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr_bombing_focus_desc: "We cannot rely on air superiority or close-air support when we are so extremely limited with how much we could spend for the Luftwehr. Why fight for airspace, when a single bomber could easily raid an unguarded place and go back without even getting into a fight? We can't afford a massive fleet of fighters or interceptors. It is better that we have bombers to quickly do their work without getting intercepted."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr_zwitscher_plan: "Plan the Zwitscher"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr_zwitscher_plan_desc: "By now, we have a fairly good idea what kinds of fighter planes will best suit the role of establishing air superiority for the Luftwehr. So our experts came up with a fighter plane called the \"Zwitscher.\" It's the best that we can currently manage to create, when considering our economical and resource situation, as well as how we need it to meet various design requirements."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr_geier_plan: "Plan the Geier"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr_geier_plan_desc: "The Geier, a highly advanced close-air ground support airplane. Armed to the teeth with multiple automatic cannons, and bombs, as well as a very tough body armor; our concepts show that this thing could dish out damage while being able to take what's thrown against it back. Our research teams have created designs and concepts on the Geier for years now, we just need to choose one."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr_adler_plan: "Plan the Adler"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr_adler_plan_desc: "The Adler, our project for a super bomber plane that can take on heavier load and also take in more bullets. For now, it's still being planned and designed, but we can accelerate production some loosened red tape and get a small number of engineers working together in a private property while our company oversees their progress, paying them generously if they show great results."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr_recruit_young_pilots: "Prefer Young Pilots"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr_recruit_young_pilots_desc: "While having veterans to lead is important, having younger ones gives a lot more advantages to our future military power projection. Our older members would retire as time goes on. Having an army filled with fresh graduates wouldn't be able to easily replace the skills and experience that we lost over time, but we get a lot more manpower for less pay if we train young pilots."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr_recruit_veteran_pilots: "Prefer Veteran Pilots"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr_recruit_veteran_pilots_desc: "Young people have a lot of potential and they are quite easy to mold to whatever role you give them to play, but one thing that makes veteran pilots valuable is experience. No training could ever amount to real life, high-risk situations which will demand quick thinking and hard decision making. We'll have less pilots, but we'd make up for it with superior skills and tactics that could compensate the numbers we are lacking."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr_build_the_projects: "Realize the Projects"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr_build_the_projects_desc: "We have had the choice between focusing on air superiority, ground support, and bombers. Now, that we have chosen and properly financed the designs our experts have developed, it's finally time to realize the project we chose."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht: "The Seewacht"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_desc: "The Seewacht is our to-be naval force for protecting ourselves from invasion and threats, and make our presence known in the continent by being able to stand our own with our fleet."
  BEL_fascism_war_the_luftwehr_build_the_projects_fallback_tt: "When we decided on a plane design, we will build it!"

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_light_ship_focus: "Light Ship Focus"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_light_ship_focus_desc: "A balanced navy is ideal but beyond our budget. A light ship-focused navy offers more flexibility, with enough firepower for other light ships and the speed and numbers to evade or swarm larger vessels. Quick to produce, light ships are practical for smaller nations, allowing fast replacement—unlike costly battleships that take years to rebuild, especially in wartime."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_light_ship_construct_mass_naval_bases: "Construct Mass-Dockyards"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_light_ship_construct_mass_naval_bases_desc: "We have practically no naval yards and such would cripple us in times of war. Thus we should create many small docks across the coast, protected by our near-future coastguard forces to produce naval craft. Our new vessels would protect these ports from attacks to ensure a supply of newly produced ships in war time."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_light_ship_finance_screen_research: "Finance Screen Research"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_light_ship_finance_screen_research_desc: "Before building, comes research. The destroyer ships will be what will form our entire navy because it gives us a better chance in dealing with larger ships than those who invest in heavy shipbuilding. We wouldn't be able to fight with much heavier ships directly, but we're gonna employ cheap tactics to ensure their expensive ships sink and be reduced into scrap metal before we lose any amount of our fleet."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_light_ship_steal_construction_plans: "Steal Construction Plans"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_light_ship_steal_construction_plans_desc: "There is no time to waste in making plans, so we must take the risk and steal them. It might give us negative effects on our diplomatic relationship with other powers, but we should remember that national defense trumps international relationships every time when it comes down to life and death situations."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_light_ship_request_support: "Request Ship-Designing Support"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_light_ship_request_support_desc: "We must admit that we have no experience with ship designing and there are others who know how to make light-ships due to historical factors or practical reasons. They know things we don't. Requesting support from those experienced nations might give us additional expenses, but it's far more worth it than the price we have to pay if our amateurish light ships get sunk by enemy fire early into combat."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_light_ship_design_yuuki_and_yuno: "Design the Yuuki and the Yuno"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_light_ship_design_yuuki_and_yuno_desc: "A pair of light ships, one a destroyer and one a cruiser are to be designed and built after careful planning. We had been developing the necessary facilities and researching for a long while to prepare for this moment. It's finally time to show to everyone what our Seewacht can do once in operation."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_capital_focus: "Capital Ship Focus"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_capital_focus_desc: "While light ships can be useful, the main focus of most navies in Europe is capital ship power and so we must adapt to the trends of warfare to be successful. Capital ships provide heavy firepower which can lay waste to groups of smaller vessels quite easily if employed well. Having a few powerful vessels than many weak ones gives us an advantage in any engagement where quality plays a much bigger role than quantity."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_capital_focus_pretrain_crews: "Pretrain Crews"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_capital_focus_pretrain_crews_desc: "While we're planning to make our capital ships, it would also be best if we train our sailors ahead of time, and even those engineers who'll manage the logistics for maintenance, repairs and further developments. Having a pool of talent to rely on would make sure that we keep producing competent naval servicemen and expand our capabilities more effectively as time progresses on."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_capital_focus_prepare_harbors: "Prepare Harbors"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_capital_focus_prepare_harbors_desc: "Our naval output is essentially zero, with every harbor being merely civilian based without any sort of military aspect. In order to get an actual fighting force off the ground, especially with capital ships, we need harbors capable of supporting military operations. Not only this, but these new bases need to be defended as well, as they will become viable targets in a war situation."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_capital_focus_recruit_sailors: "Recruit Sailors"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_capital_focus_recruit_sailors_desc: "A navy needs sailors, but what kind? Masses of new and untrained sailors allow us to man our new fleet relatively safely. Veterans however provide valuable experience and skills that raw recruits simply don't possess. Both options have their merits but, ultimately, it falls on us to decide which one to choose."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_capital_focus_plan_megumin: "Plan the Megumin"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_capital_focus_plan_megumin_desc: "The Megumin is the future capital ship that could change the tides of time in our favor. Incredible firepower, the most modern equipment, top notch armor and all around strength, as well as affordability are all aspects that define this powerful project we're working on right now. This will be able to counter the greatest of threats we might encounter."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_capital_focus_build_megumin: "Build the Megumin"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_capital_focus_build_megumin_desc: "It's time to bring the blueprints into action and construct this monster piece by piece. Everyone knows that such a project takes time, effort, money, and sacrifice; so we will focus on this project for the entire duration until it's finished and operational. Time to defend our seas from enemies, whoever they might be or whatever their intention is against us."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_carrier_focus: "Carrier Focus"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_carrier_focus_desc: "Aircraft carriers have changed naval warfare forever - no longer will massive gunnery duels be common place between ships, at least not unless those involved do not possess Carriers themselves. Aircraft, launched from a great distance away, can ensure we do not risk losing expensive assets like capital ships and instead destroy enemy vessels."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_carrier_focus_create_naval_aerial_battalion: "Create the Naval-Aerial Battalion"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_carrier_focus_create_naval_aerial_battalion_desc: "In order to operate aircraft carriers, one needs to first of all have a well trained air corps for said carriers. Secondly, they need an organized hierarchy to operate within, otherwise disorder would prevail and our objectives won't be met at all. We need an independent battalion just for carrier affairs, from its security, crewmen, air forces, engineering and logistics personnel."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_carrier_focus_prepare_the_pilots: "Prepare the Pilots"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_carrier_focus_prepare_the_pilots_desc: "Before carriers could be planned, first come the pilots that will man them. To fill our ranks with a steady stream of veterans we shall begin training new pilots as soon as possible. Besides this we can request transfers from air-force personnel over to the naval branch. Such transfers would mean they start with aerial experience, something which can be invaluable down the line if properly developed."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_carrier_focus_finance_carrier_research: "Finance Carrier Research"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_carrier_focus_finance_carrier_research_desc: "Without knowledge of how to build a carrier, building them is impossible. By financing research on the matter we can begin looking into what makes them work and start taking the first steps towards creating some of our own. Research will either take a significant period of time, or a significant investment, but it is essential nonetheless."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_carrier_focus_dream_up_the_asuka_desc: "The concept of the greatest aircraft carrier has never been truly realized, until today. The Asuka is the ultimate combination of speed, capacity, and durability; something that other nations' aircraft carriers couldn't even match up to. The future of aircraft carriers starts today, right here at home, and nothing will stop us in making this dream come true."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_carrier_focus_construct_the_asuka: "Construct the Asuka"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_carrier_focus_construct_the_asuka_desc: "Now that research has shown what works and doesn't work, as well as coming up with a solid blueprint that looks promising enough to build, it's finally the time to let the engineers and workers bring this glorious plan to fruition. With the best workers and engineers available on the field, we'll construct the greatest aircraft carrier ever known to mankind, right in the heart of our nation's pride. Coming forth, §CAsuka§!!"

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_submarine_focus: "Submarine Focus"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_submarine_focus_desc: "Most see submarines as lesser vessels, only useful for patrol and occasional hit and run attacks. However, in a defensive and guerrilla style campaign these stealthy vessels can become far more useful then simple battleships and other capital vessels. Not only this but, if done well, submarine fleets can potentially win decisive victories before heavier assets are called in to support them."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_submarine_focus_sponsor_sub_experiments: "Sponsor Submarine Experiments"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_submarine_focus_sponsor_sub_experiments_desc: "Submarines require extensive research and development to make viable combat tools, unlike standard ships which are proven in practice. While some nations do indeed possess large submarine fleets, those same nations might not necessarily wish to assist us, which means we may need to do such research ourselves, and since a lot of small companies are already experimenting with them, we could try and invest in those experiments rather than wasting government money trying to figure things out from scratch ourselves."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_submarine_focus_sailor_campaign: "Start a sailor campaign"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_submarine_focus_sailor_campaign_desc: "Without sailors, no navy can function, however for our case we require specific skills to carry out our submarine doctrine. Firstly, we need men familiar with working in confined spaces, without sunlight and generally in quite unpleasant conditions. To get people like this we need to appeal to people who enjoy challenges as well as a general sense of adventure. Maybe mentioning that there will be a lot of girls there will get more recruits..."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_submarine_focus_research_modern_submarines: "Research Modern Submarines"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_submarine_focus_research_modern_submarines_desc: "Our nation is in dire need of a modern submarine program for effective use of a potential submersible force, not using obsolete models is important to ensure that they are not destroyed by other, more advanced submarines in any future wars that may occur. As such we should aim to develop some form of new submarine that is competitive among others and not rendered obsolete as of yet."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_submarine_focus_train_sub_personel: "Train Submarine Personel"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_submarine_focus_train_sub_personel_desc: "Before constructing a large force of submarines, we need to train the people who would manage them in the first place. Engineers, maintenance, logistics, medical, military leaders and submarine crews all need to undergo a period of learning the specifics of the trade they would participate in. Even a minor detail left unattended due to negligence, stupidity, and lack of professionalism could cost us an entire submarine."

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_submarine_focus_create_the_ryuko: "Create the Ryūko"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_submarine_focus_create_the_ryuko_desc: "With everything needed set in place, we need to move forward in actually manufacturing submarines capable of performing the tasks we intend for them. For the one that will conquer the seas and instill terror amongst those who sail through them, we shall name this special vessel the 'Ryūko'!"

  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_sail_the_seven_seas: "Sail the Seven Seas"
  BEL_fascism_war_the_seewacht_sail_the_seven_seas_desc: "With a fleet finally assembled, we should show Europe exactly what our navy can accomplish. War is still fresh in everyone's minds and it's unlikely that major conflict would occur anytime soon, as such sending our navy on an expedition to showcase our power is reasonable."

  BEL_fascism_war_finalize_kriegsamt: "Finalize the Kriegsamt"
  BEL_fascism_war_finalize_kriegsamt_desc: "We can never really predict where our navy is going next. It could be as small as dealing with terrorism, or as big as war breaking out again after two decades of peace. But with how we are now, we can confidently predict the outcome of each step that eventually leads to victory in the end."





  BEL_fascism_research_advanced_weapons_research_initiative: "Advanced Weapons Research Initiative"
  BEL_fascism_research_advanced_weapons_research_initiative_desc: "Although our military armament may seem decent currently, the world advances very fast, and keeping up to date with current technologies will give us an advantage over any enemy we would encounter. We'll invest further into research and development of advanced weaponry so that we may surpass our adversaries and neutralize any threats."

  BEL_fascism_research_nuclear: "Focus on Experimental Bombs"
  BEL_fascism_research_nuclear_desc: "Sometimes, the normal bomb just won't cut through enemy defenses. At other times, dropping too many bombs just wouldn't be enough to level enemy strong points and command centers. With such situations at hand, an experimental super bomb should do the trick. All it takes is one drop and all our worries about a problem disappear with an almighty boom."

  BEL_fascism_research_improve_radar_technology: "Improve Radar Technology"
  BEL_fascism_research_improve_radar_technology_desc: "A better radar coverage is necessary to anticipate hostile movements on air. It gives us advance notice that we could prepare against before enemy units even reach the border, and seems to be vital to the development of the experimental bombs we're investing in. A wide array of radars also helps us spot enemies easier once those experimental bombs are dropped, ensuring maximum damage."

  BEL_fascism_research_invest_in_bombers: "Invest in Bombers"
  BEL_fascism_research_invest_in_bombers_desc: "Although bombers are the most expensive asset we have right now, they remain to be our trump card in terms of both defense and offense. Adding to that, we have to realize the potential of having better bombers when used alongside experimental bombs. A new bomber project can help us with achieving better results for both aerial engagements and bombing campaigns."

  BEL_fascism_research_fund_atomic_sciences: "Fund Atomic Sciences"
  BEL_fascism_research_fund_atomic_sciences_desc: "Theoretical sciences are just as important as practical sciences. If we keep supporting theoretical atomic sciences, it may prove to be a good thing later down the road. It takes time and effort to perfect atomic research, but once successful, it will certainly play a pivotal role in developing weapons that have yet been developed, or were only conceptualized but remained undeveloped because nobody had the money to finance them."

  BEL_fascism_research_test_nuclear_power: "Test our Nuclear Power"
  BEL_fascism_research_test_nuclear_power_desc: "It's not enough that we know how nuclear research works and how to use them. We must test our capabilities so we know where we stand and what improvements can be made along the way. This helps us evaluate and reflect upon what's been accomplished and find ways to make progress faster as the scientific community continues to work with nuclear research and development for our country's future projects regarding national defense."

  BEL_fascism_research_practice_bombing_runs: "Practice Bombing Runs"
  BEL_fascism_research_practice_bombing_runs_desc: "By simulating actual bombing runs and practicing them regularly, we can see the flaws and benefits of our bombers as they operate against predetermined targets. A comprehensive study and reflection on those bombing runs should help improve the development of new bomber models, while enhancing the skills of our pilots to accurately land their ordnance."

  BEL_fascism_research_construct_nuclear_reactors: "Construct Nuclear Reactors"
  BEL_fascism_research_construct_nuclear_reactors_desc: "Nuclear energy is the future, and will probably replace all the aging power plants we have today. The only way to get a good understanding of its capabilities and long-term usage is through testing it in the real world. Constructing nuclear reactors will enable us to fully grasp how beneficial it is to apply this technology into the national grid, and later into more advanced projects that require this amount of energy output."

  BEL_fascism_research_build_the_bomb: "Build the Bomb"
  BEL_fascism_research_build_the_bomb_desc: "Now that we've got everything prepared for building the nukes, we have to commence production as early as we could to remain relevant in the international community. Being able to deliver this devastating blow to our foes grants us greater bargaining power to impose what we want and take whatever we deem necessary. Nobody can stop us now."

  BEL_fascism_research_become_a_nuclear_power: "Become a Nuclear Power"
  BEL_fascism_research_become_a_nuclear_power_desc: "Having nuclear reactors alone doesn't make a country a nuclear power, nor does possessing nuclear energy. What matters is whether a country can produce a nuclear weapon from all that energy generated and used. Possessing such weapons brings our status up a notch and gives us an upper hand over neighboring countries, whether we're open about it or not."
  BEL_fascism_research_become_a_nuclear_power_tt: "The National Spirit provides a §Ymassive§! bonus to nuclear productions!"




  BEL_fascism_modernist_designs: "Modernize our Designs"
  BEL_fascism_modernist_designs_desc: "Our divisions and designs have gone stale from being old and outdated. Upgrading our tanks with newer, stronger material, our planes to make them more agile and deadly, and improving our division designs and tactics will enable us to keep pace with other European nations, if not push ahead of them in effectiveness."

  BEL_fascism_modernist_strategists: "Appoint Experienced Strategists"
  BEL_fascism_modernist_strategists_desc: "Theorizing and simulating various strategies without the pressure of having to be responsible for the deaths of soldiers is a good thing, but actual lived experience is something that remains to be unmatched in value. That's why bringing in experienced strategists from the retired veteran pool can significantly help with developing sound military doctrines for different kinds of scenarios and environments, even in worse-case."

  BEL_fascism_modernist_tacticians: "Appoint Experienced Tacticians"
  BEL_fascism_modernist_tacticians_desc: "In the heat of battle, no amount of planning ensures victory. The necessity of quick thinking and adaptability becomes the prime concern for tacticians on the ground, and none are better than those who have proven themselves already from past battles. Their expertise can teach us how to overcome the enemy and reduce our casualties through applying what worked back then to present training standards."

  BEL_fascism_modernist_revise_army_designs: "Revise our Army Designs"
  BEL_fascism_modernist_revise_army_designs_desc: "No matter how strong a single soldier is, he won't survive long on his own and that's why we've got divisions: to effectively utilize the strength of many working together under an established hierarchy. As time progresses, we continue to learn what works and what doesn't. Revising our army division designs every once in a while can bring about improved efficiency in dealing with different types of operations."

  BEL_fascism_modernist_revise_navy_designs: "Revise our Naval Designs"
  BEL_fascism_modernist_revise_navy_designs_desc: "The navy plays a crucial part in modern warfare because we live in a world full of waters to traverse upon, and whoever holds supremacy above them will win over whoever lags behind. Making adjustments to the composition and type of ships we deploy gives us an edge against those who haven't caught up in modernizing their fleets for the demands of engagements in the current time."

  BEL_fascism_modernist_revise_air_designs: "Revise our Air Design"
  BEL_fascism_modernist_revise_air_designs_desc: "Air superiority is what enables us to hold air raids against the enemies. In order for it to happen, we must be a step ahead of those we face off in the skies. Redesigning our planes from frame to equipment based on previous experiences in testing them out will surely improve their performance for upcoming encounters. Knowing which plane works best for a any scenario can also determine whether we win or lose."

  BEL_fascism_modernist_remain_the_most_adaptable: "Remain the Most Adaptable"
  BEL_fascism_modernist_remain_the_most_adaptable_desc: "We, the Tomboys, have always been the underdogs in almost every aspect. However, our adaptive nature allowed us to cope up with changes and adjust accordingly better than anyone else. Because of this, we managed to survive despite oppression and discrimination. We cannot allow such advantage to be forgotten over time. We will revive those aspects that led us to become what we are now!"




  BEL_fascism_war_our_ambitions: "Our Ambitions"
  BEL_fascism_war_our_ambitions_desc: "Isolationism or Expansionism, we have to decide on one or the others since we don't have enough resources and manpower to pursue both paths at the same time. Focusing inwardly is important for self-sustainability, whereas focusing outwardly may give us access to valuable territories and strategic positions. We must decide upon these as soon as possible."


  BEL_fascism_isolationism: "Isolationism"
  BEL_fascism_isolationism_desc: "We chose Isolationism over Expansionism. We realized that going on the offensive is a risk we cannot afford to take, and focusing on self-sustainability, as difficult as it might be given our current standing, is necessary for lasting the tests of time. With Isolationism being chosen over Expansionism, it will take effect in all branches of our country, people, and government."

  BEL_fascism_isolationism_close_borders: "Close the Borders"
  BEL_fascism_isolationism_close_borders_desc: "Going full Isolationism requires closing our borders and preventing the emigration of brainwashed Tomboys, and immigration of subversive outsiders who will poison our way of life. We must do so in order to fully take advantage of all our people's talents and abilities without other countries stealing them through propaganda, and to protect ourselves from ideological infiltration."

  BEL_fascism_isolationism_radical_agricultural_reforms: "Radical Agricultural Reforms"
  BEL_fascism_isolationism_radical_agricultural_reforms_desc: "Since our isolation cut us off from imports, we have had a lot of trouble trying to produce our own food, especially because of how much of our agriculture was reliant on outside input. That ends today - we'll reform our agricultural industry entirely in order to achieve total self-reliance and be rid of all famines caused by sanctions or isolation for good."

  BEL_fascism_isolationism_strengthen_the_border: "Secure the Border"
  BEL_fascism_isolationism_strengthen_the_border_desc: "The borders have been closed, and so we need to start securing it with military hardware, walls, traps, landmines, anything that could stop the enemy from invading us whenever that may come. Doing so allows us to allocate less troops in securing the border, enabling us to have more reserves just in case war breaks out sooner than expected, and put an end to illegal immigration once and for all, and all who try will die."

  BEL_fascism_isolationism_hail_mary_the_economy: "Hail Mary the Economy"
  BEL_fascism_isolationism_hail_mary_the_economy_desc: "Our economy hasn't been doing so well due to the aftermath of the Great Depression and years of turmoil, and our isolationism has only worsened it. In order to revive the economy, we will need to go drastic measures in restructuring the economic system into whatever makes us flourish again, no matter how much reforms it takes, no matter how unconventional they turn out to be, and no matter how many attempts."

  BEL_fascism_isolationism_revive_the_science_sector: "Revitalize the Scientific Sector"
  BEL_fascism_isolationism_revive_the_science_sector_desc: "We have a downright awful scientific base, which prevents us from producing high-end industrial equipment and developing weapons of any kind, especially modern ones. To deal with this we'll have to fix the brain drain affecting our population. Offering grants, funding, scholarships, apprenticeships, and subsidies to prospective students and professionals alike, we can revitalize our scientific sector."

  BEL_fascism_isolationism_build_southern_shield: "Build the Südschild"
  BEL_fascism_isolationism_build_southern_shield_desc: "France is one of our largest neighbors in terms of geography. We cannot leave the border between us undefended. They may pose an existential threat to our national sovereignty. Building defenses along the southern border guarantees our survival against any future French incursions against our country. With this shield, we are free to pursue a national buildup without the fear of the envy of the French."

  BEL_fascism_isolationism_isolate_the_media: "Isolate the Media"
  BEL_fascism_isolationism_isolate_the_media_desc: "Controlling the media is the key to control the flow of information throughout our entire country. By nationalizing the media, we can prevent the spread of lies and misinformation by the enemies of the state who wish nothing but the collapse of everything we hold dear in our society. Spreading positivity and hope to our citizens through media will empower them to endure hardships and fight against anyone who dare disrupt peace in our time."

  BEL_fascism_isolationism_build_north_east_wall: "Build the Nord-Ost-Wall"
  BEL_fascism_isolationism_build_north_east_wall_desc: "Our North and East have been vulnerable forever, and the Great War has shown it. We have to build defenses there. Germany and the Netherlands aren't to be trusted, and it's only a matter of time until they begin demanding concessions. Preparing for a defensible position will put us ahead in any upcoming conflict we may find ourselves in with these countries and their imperialistic agenda towards us and our neighbors."

  BEL_fascism_isolationism_defend_the_air: "Defend the Air"
  BEL_fascism_isolationism_defend_the_air_desc: "Nothing is worse than aerial bombardment that turns entire cities into rubble, causing thousands of deaths per attack. Building an anti-air network consisting of micro-interceptors and FLAK batteries would ensure our safety against this fate, and protect our people from the terror bombers of the bloodthirsty nations around us."

  BEL_fascism_isolationism_crush_the_black_market: "Crush the Black Market"
  BEL_fascism_isolationism_crush_the_black_market_desc: "An underground economy exists within our country, and it threatens the well-being of innocent citizens everyday through the unchecked distribution of illicit goods. A crack down operation will severely weaken their forces, giving way for law and order to reign supreme once more. We must ensure this black market of foreign goods is crushed completely and finally."

  BEL_fascism_isolationism_westwall: "Build the Westwall"
  BEL_fascism_isolationism_westwall_desc: "The English, Americans, French and Germans are all known to possess considerable naval assets. No doubt that if war ever erupts then these navies would target us. Therefore constructing shore batteries, patrol boats and sea mines will deny these nations the ability to establish naval superiority in our coastlines, allowing us to protect our interests overseas without fearing retribution from our home being attacked directly by sea forces."

  BEL_fascism_isolationism_discipline_the_military: "Discipline the Military"
  BEL_fascism_isolationism_discipline_the_military_desc: "A well-disciplined army is crucial in wartime scenarios, and our military is the opposite of that, plain and simple. An unruly mob will hardly get anywhere, no matter the numerical superiority in comparison to an organized force. Introducing discipline in the form of professional training and education will provide the foundation upon which our armed forces may grow into a potent fighting force fit for our people."

  BEL_fascism_isolationism_construct_city_defenses: "Construct City Defenses"
  BEL_fascism_isolationism_construct_city_defenses_desc: "With war becoming more inevitable with each passing day, it would be prudent to begin building fortifications inside of our cities to make any urban fighting complete hell for any enemy that dares to invade. Machine-gun nests in every corner and basement, bunkers in the outskirts and town square, pillboxes in residential areas, and rigid citizen training to ensure their safety, and enough resources to support militias, will make the cities hell."

  BEL_fascism_isolationism_iron_fortress: "The Iron Fortress"
  BEL_fascism_isolationism_iron_fortress_desc: "Our country shall become an Iron Fortress - impenetrable from all sides and directions. The previous layers of defense aren't sufficient enough to ward off enemies away. Constructing even more advanced versions of those defensive structures, increasing military presence tenfold, distributing rifles and basic munitions to civilians for militia service, digging trenches for cover in times of bombardments, we must become the fortress of Europe!"

  BEL_fascism_expansionism: "Expansionism"
  BEL_fascism_expansionism_desc: "It's unrealistic to remain isolationist in a world that is tensing closer and closer to another global war. We'll inevitably find ourselves faced with an enemy, no matter how defensive or pacifist we act. We must strike preemptively before anyone could threaten our sovereignty, and secure territories that already house our people but belong to hostile regimes. Our women, our soil - nowhere else should they belong but under us only."

  BEL_fascism_expansionism_advertize_army: "Launch Recruitment Campaigns"
  BEL_fascism_expansionism_advertize_army_desc: "We need more manpower for our military forces. Propaganda that highlights how foreign nations are abusing our women, and portraying them as evil beings who wish to destroy our culture will invoke feelings of patriotism and a sense of duty towards serving in the military. Expanding recruitment campaigns targeting even men, though as low ranks only, will increase our troop strength rapidly compared to traditional methods."

  BEL_fascism_expansionism_war_is_peace: "War is Peace"
  BEL_fascism_expansionism_war_is_peace_desc: "Our people must be taught that to attain peace, one must prepare for war constantly. Keeping the war machine alive and ready keeps peace secured from those who wish to break it in favor of warmongering. A peaceful country doesn't want war and seeks for ways to resolve conflicts diplomatically, yet it must maintain a large enough army to protect itself from the true aggressors that seek for domination over Europe and our people."

  BEL_fascism_expansionism_germany_approach: "Approach [GER.GetNameDef]"
  BEL_fascism_expansionism_germany_approach_desc: "The [GER.GetAdjectiveCap]s have historically been the most friendly towards Tomboys, treating them like human beings as opposed to some mere objects of pleasure, and they share the same hate towards the capitalist pig-dogs of democracy, who abuse our people under false pretenses. Approaching them now in hopes of cooperation will strengthen our position and enable us to plan things easier."

  BEL_fascism_expansionism_on_our_own: "On our own"
  BEL_fascism_expansionism_on_our_own_desc: "There is no neighbor to trust. It's foolish to assume otherwise. Making agreements with foreign entities puts us in danger, especially if said nation isn't trustworthy enough in the first place. Our plans to liberate our people will succeed only if we avoid diplomatic relationships altogether and work solely for ourselves and by ourselves."

  BEL_fascism_expansionism_unite_the_markets: "Unite our Markets"
  BEL_fascism_expansionism_unite_the_markets_desc: "The economy remains a fragile one, and in order to properly stimulate it without crippling ourselves, we must merge our markets with our allies' markets, thereby stabilizing trade and opening new avenues for business deals that benefit both our allies and our own selves. The potential for increased prosperity in a union like this outweighs any downsides that may exist in such an arrangement."

  BEL_fascism_expansionism_separate_economies: "Separate Economies"
  BEL_fascism_expansionism_separate_economies_desc: "Merging our economies is not a good idea. We need to remain independent from any foreign interference if we wish to maintain control over our economy and sustain growth. Limited trade could remain, but otherwise cutting off financial reliance will protect our nation from economic blackmail and exploitation by larger economies that could simply annex us through the economy."

  BEL_fascism_expansionism_german_volunteers: "Invite German Volunteers"
  BEL_fascism_expansionism_german_volunteers_desc: "Some German nationalists are willing to defend our people from foreign adversaries that seek our demise, and we should take advantage of their passion for justice and fairness by inviting them to join our growing volunteer forces. Their experience and training will be useful in turning our own army into a fine-tuned military machine capable of operating on its own effectively."

  BEL_fascism_expansionism_volunteer_corps: "Form the Volunteer Corps"
  BEL_fascism_expansionism_volunteer_corps_desc: "Instead of leaving these brave volunteers to fend for themselves, we should create an official unit under our military that caters solely to foreign volunteers that will assist us during times of emergency or outright aggression by enemy forces. Having such a unit in place allows us to utilize this manpower, and helps boost our active service members that will serve as our regular troops when war comes."

  BEL_fascism_expansionism_liege_conference: "Convene the Liegé Conference"
  BEL_fascism_expansionism_liege_conference_desc: "The Liegé Conference will be where we declare our ambitions and goals towards our neighbors and our intentions concerning those territories under dispute, inhabited mostly by our people who seek freedom from oppression. Inviting these powers to attend the conference will set a stage for diplomacy that might hopefully avoid bloodshed, but will certainly provoke antagonism should we push our claims."

  BEL_fascism_expansionism_hirasawa_plan: "The Hirasawa Plan"
  BEL_fascism_expansionism_hirasawa_plan_desc: "Proposed by famous Yui Hirasawa, the Hirasawa plan are our plans for how to properly take over lands controlled by our neighbors but populated heavily by our ethnic brothers and sisters who remain oppressed under those regimes. These plans consist of meticulously planned tactics for every terrain, scenario, and season that we face during our conquests. We'll adapt it for every enemy we may face from now on."

The Germans know how to fight, and studying them closely will help us emulate their effectiveness in the field of battle."
  BEL_fascism_expansionism_germany_prepare_the_march_east_desc_war: "Invading [GER.GetNameDef] will be extremely difficult, but it's nonetheless an objective we have to achieve at any cost if we want to liberate all the Tomboys who were forced to migrate into the German state for menial labor, enslaved in farms and factories alike for hours to no end, and now even exterminated from time to time."

  BEL_fascism_expansionism_germany_fortify_the_border: "Fortify the Border"
  BEL_fascism_expansionism_germany_fortify_the_border_desc: "Whatever our relations with the Germans may be, we'll always have a rocky history that brings bad blood into negotiations. Even if we manage to not anger them, our claims alone might prove to be enough reason for the paranoid nation to declare war against us first.

  BEL_fascism_expansionism_germany_steal_german_material_desc_war: "The German equipment is exceptional in quality and we lack the ability to develop similar products on our own. A possible solution would be to send agents into the field and acquire as many weapons as possible, either by direct theft or purchase under disguise. Once acquired, we can immediately put them to use in our army."
  BEL_fascism_expansionism_germany_steal_german_material_desc_peace: "Our weapons are advanced and our equipment is well-made, and our friends in Germany need it more than ever with all the threats they're facing right now from their borders.

Providing assistance with construction work on improving their railways can make transportation much faster and easier, and gets them to see us significantly more favorably by contributing to infrastructure development that affects millions daily."
  BEL_fascism_expansionism_germany_sabotage_german_railways_desc_war: "Germany is currently moving its armies all across the map, with constant movement near our borders, and railways are a key method of transportation for supplies and soldiers.

  BEL_fascism_expansionism_germany_contruct_supply_network_desc_war: "Germany has an admirable infrastructure network, and it certainly served them well during the last World War.

  BEL_fascism_expansionism_germany_sabotage_german_war_machine_desc_war: "Not all Germans support their government's agenda, especially those who feel the burden of an ideology they did not vote for. Many are sympathetic to the Tomboy cause, even if they don't approve of everything we represent ideologically.
