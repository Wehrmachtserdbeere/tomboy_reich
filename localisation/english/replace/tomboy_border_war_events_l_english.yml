  tomboy_bw.1.d: "We have just received news that the [BEL.GetAdjective]s have managed to win the war in the Congo. They have captured the disputed lands, and the remaining [FRA.GetAdjective] troops have been defeated. What they'll do with these lands now is up to them, and it's up to them to decide the fate of the population."

  tomboy_bw.6.d: "With the news of the [BEL.GetAdjective]'s retreat, it is apparent that the [FRA.GetAdjective] have won the border conflict against the [BEL.GetAdjective]s. With the [BEL.GetAdjective]s retreating, it is clear they aren't yet strong enough to fight a war against the [FRA.GetAdjective], and they will have to prepare for a long time before they can try again. This undoubtedly reinvigorated the [FRA.GetAdjective] spirits, and crushed the [BEL.GetAdjective] morale."

With the [FRA.GetAdjective] retreating, it is clear they aren't strong enough to withstand a war against the [BEL.GetAdjective]s, and they will have to prepare for a long time before they can be sure they can.

  tomboy_bw.7.b: "Cursed be these degenerates!"
