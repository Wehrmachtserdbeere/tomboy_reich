  tomboy_liege.1.t: "Dark news from Liegé"
  tomboy_liege.1.d: "Reports about the end of the Siege of Liegé have been replaced by grim news. Instead of simply occupying the city, the invaders took it upon themselves to murder countless people, blocking them from exiting the city and slaughtering everyone in sight. Surviving eyewitnesses reported gruesome and disturbing acts committed by those responsible. One account described a large group of civilians being brought inside a house, which was the barricaded from the outside and lit on fire. Children were lifted through windows in an attempt to save them, only for them to fall victim to the occupiers. A striking image was provided to us by a journalist, who suggested using it as a cover image for our newspapers. Despite its disturbing nature, it accurately portrays the tragedy of what happened. Now we have to decide whether to publish it with this image, or wait for more moderate images to emerge for use."
  tomboy_liege.1.a: "Publicize it now."
  tomboy_liege.1.b: "Wait for now..."

  tomboy_liege.2.t: "Massacre in Liegé!"
  tomboy_liege.2.d: "Disturbing and credible accounts have emerged from the [BEL.GetAdjectiveCap] city of Liège and its surrounding districts following the recent occupation by invading forces. Eyewitness testimonies, smuggled photographs, and intercepted communications paint a harrowing picture of systematic brutality carried out against the civilian population. The occupying troops are alleged to have unleashed a campaign of terror: widespread torture, sexual violence, executions, and indiscriminate slaughter are all being reported. Entire neighborhoods have been left in ruins, their residents either murdered outright or dragged away to an uncertain fate. The accounts speak not of isolated excesses, but of an orchestrated effort to crush local resistance through sheer terror. Preliminary estimates suggest that between half a million and three-quarters of a million civilians - men, women, and children alike - have already fallen victim to the invaders' violence. The true toll may be even higher, as communications with much of the region have been severed. The international community has yet to formally respond, but if these reports are confirmed, the atrocities in Liège may stand among the darkest episodes of this war."
  tomboy_liege.2.a: "Horrifying."
  tomboy_liege.2.b: "Let them weep, we won't stop."
  tomboy_liege.2.c: "Hang the perpetrators, NOW!"
  tomboy_liege.2.e: "Dear God..."
  tomboy_liege.2.f: "Well done!"
