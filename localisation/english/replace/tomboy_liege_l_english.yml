  tomboy_liege.1.t: "Dark news from Liegé"
  tomboy_liege.1.d: "Reports about the end of the Siege of Liegé have been replaced by grim news. Instead of simply occupying the city, the invaders took it upon themselves to murder countless people, blocking them from exiting the city and slaughtering everyone in sight. Surviving eyewitnesses reported gruesome and disturbing acts committed by those responsible. One account described a large group of civilians being brought inside a house, which was the barricaded from the outside and lit on fire. Children were lifted through windows in an attempt to save them, only for them to fall victim to the occupiers. A striking image was provided to us by a journalist, who suggested using it as a cover image for our newspapers. Despite its disturbing nature, it accurately portrays the tragedy of what happened. Now we have to decide whether to publish it with this image, or wait for more moderate images to emerge for use."
  tomboy_liege.1.a: "Publicize it now."
  tomboy_liege.1.b: "Wait for now..."
