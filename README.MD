# $${\color{white}Tomboy \space \color{red}Reich}$$

## Preword

This mod does not take itself too seriously. Expect silliness, illogical things, and a lot of anime.

Please be warned that there will be offensive content in this mod. But you probably played

## $${\color{white}Is \space that \space a \space motherfucking \space \color{cyan}Th \color{pink} e \space N \color{white} ew \space \color{pink}Or \color{cyan} der \space \color{white}reference?!}$$

already, so nothing in this should disturb you.
