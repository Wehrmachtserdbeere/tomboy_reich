# $${\color{white}Tomboy \space \color{red}Reich}$$

## Preword

This mod does not take itself too seriously. Expect silliness, illogical things, and a lot of anime.

Please be warned that there will be offensive content in this mod. But you probably played:

### $${\color{cyan}The \space New \space \color{pink} Order: \space \color{white} Last \space D \color{pink} ays \space of \color{cyan} \space Europe }$$

So nothing in this should disturb you.

### FAQ

#### When is the mod finished?

When it is finished. I'm still adding to it and working on it.

#### Something offended me

Ok.

#### Is AI used in this mod?

Yes, obviously, as this game has computer-controlled enemies, which are refered to as AI.

#### Is AI-Generated imagery used in this mod?

Yes. I'm neither an artist, nor am I rich enough to hire one. Do be comforted though, I heavily edit each and every image myself.

#### Can I make a sub-mod?

Sure, just make sure you don't use images you don't have the rights to (refer to `LICENSE_AGREEMENT.txt` and `LICENSE.txt`). If you decide to make weird ideological promotions that are not meant in parody of them, I strongly suggest to state this, and make your separation from me easily apparent.

#### Is there a way I make a sub-mod, *and* use the images in this mod?

Contact me or the original creator of the images (refer to `LICENSE_AGREEMENT.txt`) with a detailed description of your mod, and we can negotiate or agree to terms about them.
