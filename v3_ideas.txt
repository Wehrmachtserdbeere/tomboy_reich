- Tomboys, Cunnies, and Femboys exist from the start.
- - Tomboys in Belgium
- - Cunnies in Nord-Pas-De-Calais?
- United Tomboy Union at the beginning that breaks apart soon after game start?
- - Maybe with puppet Cunnies and Femboys as single-state countries being disillusioned and slowly taking more and more land, eventually leading to the full breakup of the Union?

- Plan from the start, don't just make it as you go along.
- Plan interaction between the nations, e.g. Tomboys attempting a coup in Cunnyland, but if played right, Cunnies can get independent.
- Global decisions, that are available for all ideologies, so that decisions aren't held back by being implemented early, and newer ones benefit from new knowledge.
- !!! Remake the entire map (not like map modding, but replacing the countries (using replace_path) and essentially making it a total conversion)?
- Cosmetic Tags for a "Peaceful Unification" and a "Forceful Unification" ending.
- - Confederation for the peaceful one, where the nations are "Free States" (Integrated, non-annexable puppets)
- - Unitarian for the forceful one, where the nations are, well, annexed states. Perhaps with state modifiers for, e.g., "Femboy Population" that decreases military output but increases civilian output?

- Carry over loc files for victory points and state names from v2. Lots of research went into those!

- Possibly get one or more devs? Unlikely because of my erratic schedule, but certainly something to consider.

- Squash ANY bugs **IMMEDIATELY**, don't let it go on like v2 where we'll have a TON of errors to fix. Especially figure out why basegame stuff gives errors!

- Reimu Edit 2, the Hakurei Eagle. Get some inspiration, Hakurei path maybe?

- Human experimentation path (think Karl Kroenen), with even the country leader's portrait changing? Perhaps as its own path independent of ideology.

- Union of European States. Basically, invite countries, unified defense grids, and the whole shabang. Something like "Festung Europa."

- Custom ideas (the ones you can change in the country screen)
- - Racial alignment (like Nordid and such)
- - Continental bonuses (like getting a bonus to cavalry in Asia, tanks in Europe, and bombing in America)

- Anime Ural-Altaic

- Festung Europa. Whether it be nationalism only, or general right-wing on each ideology. Very long focus that adds maxxed out fortresses on coasts and the current (or European) borders, as well as on strategic borders (such as the Alps, the Carpathian Mountains, the Pyrenees, etc.

- The Fire Rises style of political focuses: Events in the world shape what you get. E.G. how losing the Taiwan War lets China have an anime girl as a leader, or how Germany only becomes far-right if Russia becomes communist and declares war. Of course, keep it fun and non-RNG-heavy.

- LESS FOCUSES, MORE VARIETY.
- - Instead of a billion focuses, make one economic section, one changing political one, an army section, etc. Don't do what v2 did and make like 7 different trees that do the exact same!!! SAVE THE PAIN, DO GFX INSTEAD OF THIS BS AGAIN, PLEASE!!!

- Natsukian Path:
- - World Domination -> Prepare Nations for independence (national spirit of fanatic loyalty) -> Release as puppets OR independent nations
- - "Exit Music" (Natsuki dies by Monika Path) -> Complete despair-schizo. Self-Annihilation. I'd say use an event to decide this, like TFR's events where you can have a character either live or die. Perhaps trigger this after some focus?
- - - BOP, if hitting AWARE, a focus tree is set that leads to the whole nation collapsing and becoming completely lifeless (with an idea for it, basically deleting everything) -> The nation did not recover from the loss.
- - - - If large enough, it causes a major crisis in other nations.
- - - If not running out, uhh, think of something. The world cannot be good without her. Perhaps a "prepare for the grimdark future" aimed tree that turns the nation hyper-isolationist and schizophrenic?
- - - Possible AI ruler post-Exit Music, with a BOP where you have to keep it "unaware" so it doesn't realize she's dead, but "aware" enough to rule effectively?
- - - - AWARE -> Portrait change and end the BOP. Run an event in xyz days that notifies the world about it.
- - - - - One idea: lineart, night, 2::dark, desaturation, depression::, 2::doki doki literature club (style)::. Black and pink color scheme.
- - - - - Make it a gif, see The Fire Rises, Loji (Chinese AI, sadly not an anime girl) uses a GIF portrait.
- - - - - Change the focus tree immediately. Any allied nation will get a "topple regime" wargoal following some BEL focuses that show the self-annihilationary intent, to try and free the Tomboys. Also give those nations the desire to "un-ally" them.
- - - - - Nuclear Annihilation ending? If so, ending event should have Monika, who caused Natsuki's death, staring in horror. Probably like the two thousand yard stare.
- - - - UNAWARE -> Full right side of the BOP, a TON of debuffs, a few balancing buffs (especially for stability, after the post-Death mass-debuffs).
- - - - - The buffs and debuffs get weaker the closer you get to AWARE, but the risk of AWARE rises exponentially.
- - - - - Should be a game of treading the line, with maybe a decision to inform the AI, where if specific recovery and preparation focuses haven't been made, it immediately leads to the AWARE focus tree. Else, it gets a "Recovered" focus tree with perhaps a main focal point of preventing any future pain, and becoming a more fleshed out TFR's Loji Compassion Path.

- Democratic Path:
- - BOP: Federal vs Unitary

- Descriptions NEED a consistent case. E.g. Character descriptions always use third person (except Natsukian AI)
