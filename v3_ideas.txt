- Tomboys, Cunnies, and Femboys exist from the start.
- - Tomboys in Belgium
- - Cunnies as Tomboy Puppet in Nord-Pas-De-Calais?
- - Femboys as Bavaria as German puppet

- Plan from the start, don't just make it as you go along.
- Plan interaction between the nations, e.g. Tomboys attempting a coup in Cunnyland, but if played right, Cunnies can get independent.
- Global decisions, that are available for all ideologies, so that decisions aren't held back by being implemented early, and newer ones benefit from new knowledge.
- Perhaps even remake the entire map (not like map modding, but replacing the countries (using replace_path) and essentially making it a total conversion)?

- Carry over loc files for victory points and state names from v2. Lots of research went into those!

- Possibly get one or more devs? Unlikely because of my erratic schedule, but certainly something to consider.

- Squash ANY bugs **IMMEDIATELY**, don't let it go on like v2 where we'll have a TON of errors to fix. Especially figure out why basegame stuff gives errors!
