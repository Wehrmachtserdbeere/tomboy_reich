- Tomboys, Cunnies, and Femboys exist from the start.
- - Tomboys in Belgium
- - Cunnies as Tomboy Puppet in Nord-Pas-De-Calais?
- - Femboys as Bavaria as German puppet

- Alternatively, United Tomboy Union at the beginning that breaks apart soon after game start?
- - Maybe with puppet Cunnies and Femboys as single-state countries being disillusioned and slowly taking more and more land, eventually leading to the full breakup of the Union?

- Plan from the start, don't just make it as you go along.
- Plan interaction between the nations, e.g. Tomboys attempting a coup in Cunnyland, but if played right, Cunnies can get independent.
- Global decisions, that are available for all ideologies, so that decisions aren't held back by being implemented early, and newer ones benefit from new knowledge.
- Perhaps even remake the entire map (not like map modding, but replacing the countries (using replace_path) and essentially making it a total conversion)?

- Carry over loc files for victory points and state names from v2. Lots of research went into those!

- Possibly get one or more devs? Unlikely because of my erratic schedule, but certainly something to consider.

- Squash ANY bugs **IMMEDIATELY**, don't let it go on like v2 where we'll have a TON of errors to fix. Especially figure out why basegame stuff gives errors!

- Reimu Edit 2, the Hakurei Eagle. Get some inspiration, Hakurei path maybe?

- Human experimentation path (think Karl Kroenen), with even the country leader's portrait changing? Perhaps as its own path independent of ideology.

- Union of European States. Basically, invite countries, unified defense grids, and the whole shabang. Something like "Festung Europa."

- Custom ideas (the ones you can change in the country screen)
- - Racial alignment (like Nordid and such)
- - Continental bonuses (like getting a bonus to cavalry in Asia, tanks in Europe, and bombing in America)

- Anime Ural-Altaic

- Festung Europa. Whether it be nationalism only, or general right-wing on each ideology. Very long focus that adds maxxed out fortresses on coasts and the current (or European) borders, as well as on strategic borders (such as the Alps, the Carpathian Mountains, the Pyrenees, etc.

- The Fire Rises style of political focuses: Events in the world shape what you get. E.G. how losing the Taiwan War lets China have an anime girl as a leader, or how Germany only becomes far-right if Russia becomes communist and declares war. Of course, keep it fun and non-RNG-heavy.

- LESS FOCUSES, MORE VARIETY.
- - Instead of a billion focuses, make one economic section, one changing political one, an army section, etc. Don't do what v2 did and make like 7 different trees that do the exact same!!! SAVE THE PAIN, DO GFX INSTEAD OF THIS BS AGAIN, PLEASE!!!

- Natsukian Path:
- - World Domination -> Prepare Nations for independence (national spirit of fanatic loyalty) -> Release as puppets OR independent nations
