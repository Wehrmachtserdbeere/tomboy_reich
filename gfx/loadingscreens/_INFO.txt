# PDX is annoying with loading screens. Follow this guide for them to show up properly.
#
# 1. Create your image at a 16:9 ratio (e.g. 1920x1080, 2560x1440, etc.)
#   a. Mind the loading bars and loading screen tips coverings
# 2. Resize canvas (not image) to the nearest 4:3 ratio by width (eg. for the above: 1920x1440, 2560x1920, etc.)
# 3. Color the new areas pure black (also known as "letterboxing"), they won't show up
# 4. Done, it will now show properly, without the letterboxing.
#	a. I have tested it with both 1920x1080 and 2560x1440 images with the above method and it works perfectly.
