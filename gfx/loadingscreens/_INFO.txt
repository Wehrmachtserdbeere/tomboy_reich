# PDX is annoying with loading screens. Follow this guide for them to show up properly.
#
# 1. Create your image at a 16:9 ratio (e.g. 1920x1080, 2560x1440, etc.)
#   a. Mind the loading bars and loading screen tips coverings
# 2. Downscale it to 1920x1080px
# 3. Resize canvas (not image) to 1920x1440px
# 4. Color the new areas pure black (also known as "letterboxing")
# 5. Done, it will now show properly, without the letterboxing.
